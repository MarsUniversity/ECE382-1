# ECE382 (Embedded Systems I) Course Website

Live site: ece.ninja/382

## Building the Site

This courseware was originally built by Todd Branchflower (https://github.com/toddbranch/).

The course materials are written in markdown.  To build it, I use a slightly modified markdown parser and some basic templating in conjunction with a build script.  These are written in javascript and run using node.js.  Here is the course-build script: https://github.com/jfalkinburg/course-build .
