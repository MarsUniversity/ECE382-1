# Parents Weekend Notes

Welcome parents to Embedded Systems I!  I'm Capt Jeffrey Falkinburg, the Course Director this semester.  But today you're in luck because you're not going to hear me talk much.

Your sons and daughters have been learning about tiny computers called microcontrollers.  *[Hold up chip.]*

These are the computers that are behind your hotel door lock or your watch or your microwave.

They've been learning how to use the features of these chips to work for them and perform useful tasks.

And **today** is their first opportunity to demonstrate that!

*[Lab 1 on projector.]*

Their job is to implement a simple calculator.

It will read a series of bytes from memory that identify different operands and operations.

*[Walk through lab on board, walk through notes as well.]*
