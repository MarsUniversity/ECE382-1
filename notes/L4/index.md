So today should be a lesson that explains a few of the things you've seen but didn't understand.

This should be the last fire-hosey lesson.

Anyone try to run a program on their MSP430 yet?

## Review

*[Review stuff on board, except for debugger question]*

- What's a debugger?  What are some things we can do with it?
- What's the `#` mean in `#0x10`?  What's the `x` mean?  What if I switched the `x` to a `b`?
- What does `add.w  r5, r6` do?  `r6 = r5 + r6`, shorthand for that is `r6 += r5`
- What does `dst |= src` mean?  What about `dst &= src`?  What about `dst ^= src`?

## Addressing Modes

Last lesson, we discussed the MSP430 instruction set.  We didn't quite get to assembly-machine conversion last time - we will today.  Learning about all of the different addressing modes also gives us a better understanding of the kinds of instructions we can write and how they work.

Luckily, the MSP430 has only 4 different addressing modes to cover.  The old S12 had a lot more.

**[Remember instruction formats: `mov.w src, dst`, `swpb dst`]**

**[On side board, mark first two as available two both, bottom two as available only to destination - circle last bit for dest]**

| As/Ad | Addressing Mode | Description | Example | Given r5=0x0200, 0x0200: 0x1234, 0x0202: 0x5678 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 00/0 | Rn	| Register direct | `mov r5, r6` | r6 = 0x0200 |
| 01/1 | offset(Rn) | Register indexed | `mov 2(r5), r6` | r6 = 0x5678 |
| 10/- | @Rn	| Register indirect | `mov @r5, r6` | r6 = 0x1234 |
| 11/- | @Rn+	| Register indirect with post-increment | `mov @r5+, r6` | r6 = 0x1234, r5 = 0x0202 |
|11/- | #XXXX | Immediate | `mov #0x2006, r6` | r6 = 0x2006 |
|01/1 | label | PC Relative | `mov label, r6` | (becomes mov.w xxxx(PC), r6) |
|01/1 | &label | Absolute | `mov &0x0200, r6` | r6 = 0x0200 | 

Let's start with a quick sample program.  *Use this program to illustrate addressing modes.*

*[Go around the room asking what each operation does.  End with: what does this program actually do?]*
```
            ; first thing's first - how do we create a comment?

            mov.w   #0x0200, r5
            mov.w   #0xbeef, r6

fill        mov.w   r6, 0(r5)           ; anyone know what this syntax means?
            incd    r5
            cmp.w   #0x0400, r5         ; what does this instruction do?
            jne     fill

forever     jmp     forever
```
*[Quckly through this]*

Review - Who can name the three different instruction types?  One operand, relative jump, and two operand.

**[On side board]**  Who recognizes this table from last time?  What is it?

Notice that in two operand, we've only got one bit for Ad - meaning it can only use two of the available addressing modes.

| 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Opcode colspan=3 | W=0/B=1 | Ad colspan=2 | Dest reg colspan=4 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | Condition colspan=3 | PC offset (10 bit) colspan=10 |
| Opcode colspan=4 | Source reg colspan=4 | Ad | W=0/B=1 | As colspan=2 | Dest reg colspan=4 |

Today, we're going to cover the full range of MSP430 addressing modes, try some conversion from assembly to machine code, and introduce you to your first computer exercise.

**[Put instruction set on projector on board]**

Relative jumps don't use addressing modes.  Let's try one of those:
```
forever    jmp     forever              ; what does this do?
```

The first 3 bits will always be `001`.  Next, we'll find the condition code - `111`.  Finally, we need to calculate the PC offset - -2 in our case, since the PC increments immediately when we execute an instruction.  Remember, we're jumping 2x the sign-extended offset.  So our jump is going to be -1 or `1111111111`.  So our hand-assembled machine code instruction is `0011 1111 1111 1111` or `3f ff` or `ff 3f` in little-endian hex.

Using an *offset* is important because it allows us to have relocatable code.  It doesn't matter where our code ultimately gets placed in memory because we're only jumping relative to our position within the code.

Disassembled:
```
c01c:	ff 3f       	jmp	$+0      	;abs 0xc01c
```

Ok, let's get into the instructions that actually use addressing modes.

### Register Mode or Register Direct

This is the most straight-forward addressing mode - taking information / values directly from the CPUs registers.  We covered it a little last time.

**[reference table]**  
If used in a one-operand instruction, the Ad value is `00`.  If used in a two operand instruction, Ad would be `0` because there are only two available addressing modes - register direct and indexed.  As would be `00`.

Example:
```
mov.w   r11,r10     ;move the word from r11 into r10 - both the source and destination addressing modes are register direct
```

What's this instruction doing?  Moving the value in r11 to r10.

Since this is a two-operand instruction, the first 4 bits are the opcode, which we'll look up - it's `0100`.  Next, we need to indicate the source register - r11, which is `1011` in binary.  Next, we need to know the addressing mode of the destination.  It's Register Direct - `0`, it only needs a single bit because there are only two ways the destination can be addressed - Register Direct or Register Indexed, so the LSB of the code.  Next, we need to know if it's a byte or word instruction.  It's a word, so `0`.  Finally, source addressing mode - also Register Direct, so `00`.  Finally, we need the destination register, r10 - `1010`.  So our hand-assembled machine code instruction is `0100 1011 0000 1010` or `4b 0a` or `0a 4b` in little-endian hex.

Disassembled:
```
c010:	0a 4b       	mov	r11,	r10	
```

Another example:
```
swpb    r10         ;swap the upper and lower byte of r10
```

What's this instruction doing?  Swapping the upper and lower bytes of r10.

Since this is a one-operand instruction, the first 6 bits are `000100`.  Next, we need the opcode, which we'll look up - `001`.  Next, B/W - only word available for this, so `0`.  Next, Ad - Register Direct, so `00`.  Finally, destination register - r10, so `1010`.  Final binary is `0001 0000 1000 1010` or `10 8a` or `8a 10` in little-endian hex.

Disassembled:
```
c012:	8a 10       	swpb	r10		
```

### Indexed Mode

In this mode, you're adding an offset to a given register to determine the actual address.

Example:
```
; r10 = 0xc000

add.w   4(r10), r11
```

This would say find the value at the memory address 4 + r10 = 0xc004 and add it to r11.  So we'd find the value at memory address 0xc004 and add it to the value in r11 and store the result in r11.

Another example.  **Ask them what this is doing based on what they just learned**.
```
mov.w   #0x200, r6
mov.w   #0xbeef, 2(r6)    ;places 0xbeef at address 0x0202
mov.w   r6, r5
mov.w   2(r6), 6(r5)   ;this would move the word in the memory location at 2+r6 into the memory location at 6+r5 - so 0xbeef will be copied to 0x0206
```
Disassembled:
```
c01c:	36 40 00 02 	mov	#512,	r6	;#0x0200
c020:	b6 40 ef be 	mov	#-16657,2(r6)	;#0xbeef, 0x0002(r6)
c024:	02 00 
c026:	05 46       	mov	r6,	r5	
c028:	95 46 02 00 	mov	2(r6),	6(r5)	;0x0002(r6), 0x0006(r5)
c02c:	06 00 
```

**[reference table]**
If used in a one-operand instruction, the Ad value is `01`.  If used in a two operand instruction, Ad would be `1`.   As would be `01`.

**show disassembly of final instruction first this time, but show it in word format - not little endian**

Let's look at the final `mov` instruction above.  This is the first time we've looked at a three-word instruction.  The second word is holding our source offset and the third word is holding our destination offset.  These are called extension words.  If we specify Register Indexed, the CPU knows to look at the PC for the offset and then increment it afterwards!

Let's hand-assemble it.  What type of instruction is this?  Since it's a two-operand instruction, first is the opcode - `0100` in this case.  Then is the source register - r6 - `0110`.  Then comes destination addressing mode - Register Indexed - `1`.  Next, B/W - `0` for word.  Next, source addressing mode - Register Indexed - `01`.  Finally, destination register - r5 - `0101`.  Binary instruction is `0100 0110 1001 0101` or `95 46` in little-endian hex.  Each offset is an extension word.  So the final instruction is `95 46 02 00 06 00`.

It may seem a little convoluted right now - why would we address this way?  We'll see that this addressing mode is extremely useful when working with higher level data structures like arrays or referencing variables on the stack once we begin to work with C.

#### PC Relative

We can also index off of the program counter!  It might look something like this:
```
    mov.w   magic_number, r7

magic_number:
    .word   0xafaf
```

In practice, the assembler will convert our magic_number reference to an offset from the program counter and replace it with XXXX(r0).

But be careful - this only works for locations that are always the same distance relative to the PC.  Remember our relocatable code - it's going to move once we link it.  Absolute locations, like peripherals, or locations that get located away from our executable code, like RAM, wouldn't work.  That's why we use the `&`, which we'll talk about later.

If you want the actual memory address of `magic_number`, you'd need to use what?  The `#` for immediate.

### Register Indirect Mode

```
; r6 contains 0x0200

mov.w   @r6, 2(r6)          ; saying @r6 same as saying 0(r6)
```

This would move whatever is at 0x0200 into 0x202

Register indirect is when you're accessing the value at the *memory location* contained in a register.  It is the same as using Register Indexed with an offset of 0.  The reason you'd use this instead is that it saves a word of memory - you don't need to specify an extension word of 0!

**[ref table]**

This addressing mode is available only for the source in two-operand and is coded `10`.

Another example:
```
mov.w   #0x200, r6          ;storing the location of the start of RAM in r6
mov.w   #0xcccc, &0x0200    ;storing 0xcccc at that location
mov.w   @r6, r7             ;now 0xcccc is in r7
```

Let's hand-assemble the last instruction to see what's going on.  First, is the opcode - `0100`.  Next, source register - r6 - `0110`.  Next, Ad - register direct, so `0`.  Next, B/W - word, so `0`.  Next, As - register indirect, so `10`.  Finally, destination register - r7, `0111`.  Binary - `0100 0110 0010 0111`, or `46 27` or little-endian hex - `27 46`.  Note no extension word!

This would be useful if a register holds a memory address instead of a value.

Disassembled:
```
c032:	36 40 00 02 	mov	#512,	r6	;#0x0200
c036:	b2 40 cc cc 	mov	#-13108,&0x0200	;#0xcccc
c03a:	00 02 
c03c:	27 46       	mov	@r6,	r7	
```

You can't use this in the destination - `mov.w  r7, @r8` won't work.  What's an easy workaround?

**Even though the single operand instruction specifies Ad, since it has two bits it can use all addressing modes - so you can use this mode with single operand instructions.  `swpb    @r8` is completely valid.**

### Register Indirect Mode with Post-Increment

Let's say r8 contained `0xc000`.  The instruction `mov.w   @r8+, r7` would move the value at 0xc000 to r7, then increment r8 to `0xc002`.

This is the same as the Register Indirect, but we'll increment by two the address contained in the register afterwards.    It is extremely useful in specifying immediate values for instructions.

**reference table**

This addressing mode is available only for the source in two operand and is coded `11`.

Here's a tricky example:
```
mov.w   #0xC7, r9   ;move C7 into r9 - only destination uses register direct.
```

```
c014:	39 40 c7 00 	mov	#199,	r9	;#0x00c7
```

First, what's the opcode?  `0100`.  Next, we need source register - we're using immediate, indicated by the #.  In assembly, this means we'll specify the value in the instruction.  In machine code, this means we'll put the value immediately after the instruction and reference it using the PC - see how `c7 00` is right after the instruction in the disassembly?  This is known is **register indirect** because we'll take the value in the register as an *address* and use the value at that address.  We'll also want to increment the PC by 2 after so it points to the next instruction - known as **post-increment**.  The PC is r0, `0000`.  Next, destination addressing mode - register direct, so `0`.  Next, B/W - word, so `0`.  Next, source addressing mode - register indirect with post increment as we said earlier - `11`.  Next, destination register - r9, which is `1001`.  Our binary instruction is `0100 0000 0011 1001` or `40 39` or `39 40` in little-endian hex.


An immediate cannot be used for the destination!

### Special Cases

Let's look at a few instructions that might look like ones we've covered, but are handled differently by the MSP430.

```
bis.b   #0xFF, r6   ;set all the bits in r6.  in this instruction, only the destination addressing mode would be register direct 
```

**show disassembly first, in word format**

Disassembled:
```
c018:	76 d3       	bis.b	#-1,	r6	;r3 As==11
```

*[Start going through conversion of `bis.b` instruction]*

First, what's the opcode?  `1101`.  Next, we need source register - we're using immediate, so the PC `0000`.  Next, destination addressing mode - register direct, so `0`.  Next, B/W - byte, so `1`.  Next, As - register indirect with post-increment, so `11`.  Next, destination register - r6 - `0110`.  So our binary instruction is `1101 0000 0111 0110` or `76 d0` in little-endian hex.  But that doesn't match with the disassembly!  And I don't see an extension word for the immediate value in there either.  What's going on?!

The designers of the MSP430 realized that some of our registers don't make sense to use in certain addressing modes.  The Status Register, which we'll learn about next time, holds various flags - whether the result of the previous operation was 0, whether it was negative, whether it overflowed, etc.  It doesn't make sense to use this in addressing for anything other than register direct.  The same thing goes for R3, which gives a constant zero.  They exploit these available addressing modes by using them to code certain common constants without having to use extension words!  `0xFF` is one of those constants - so we need more information to hand-assemble this instruction.

**drawn on back board**

| As | Register | Addressing Mode | Description |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 00 | 0010 | r2 | Normal access |
| 01 | 0010 | &< location> | Absolute addressing. The extension word is used as the address directly. The leading & is TI's way of indicating that the usual PC-relative addressing should not be used. |
| 10 | 0010 | #4 | This encoding specifies the immediate constant 4. |
| 11 | 0010 | #8 | This encoding specifies the immediate constant 8. |
| 00 | 0011 | #0 | This encoding specifies the immediate constant 0.  Also normal access. |
| 01 | 0011 | #1 | This encoding specifies the immediate constant 1. |
| 10 | 0011 | #2 | This encoding specifies the immediate constant 2. |
| 11 | 0011 | #-1 | This specifies the all-bits-set constant, -1. |

If you want to access the values stored in r2/r3, register direct addressing works as normal!

Hmm, so in our `bis.b` instruction we're using the immediate -1 - which is a common constant listed above.  That means As should be `11` and the source register should be `0011`.  Let's sub that in and see if it works - our binary is now `1101001101110110` or `37 d3` in little-endian hex - consistent with our disassembly.

But, as programmers, we don't have to remember the way the constant generators work when we're writing assembly.  We can simply code immediate values and the assembler will convert them to the native format using the constant generator automatically.

```
inv.w   r5          ;remember, inv is an *emulated instruction* - it translates to xor #-1, r5 - only the destination addressing mode would be register direct
```

Let's try the the `inv r5` instruction.  Remember, this is an emulated instruction - it translates to `xor #-1, r5`.

A two-operand instruction - what's the opcode?  `1110`.  Next, we need the source register - since this is a common constant, we find the source register is r3 from the common constants table - `0011`.  Next, Ad - `0` for register direct.  Next, B/W - `0` for word.  The source register also comes from the common constant table - `11`.  Finally, the destination register - r5 - `0101`.  Binary - `1110 0011 0011 0101`, little-endian hex - `35 e3`.

Disassembled:
```
c01a:	35 e3       	inv	r5		
```

#### Absolute Mode

If there's an extension word, how is it usually interpreted?  As an offset for register indirect or an immediate value!

But what if we want to go to that exact address - don't want any relative addressing?

The last mode we'll talk about is **absolute addressing** - a unique mode given in the common constants table.  In this mode, you are specifying an absolute location in memory.  You precede the location with an & to tell the assembler this is a literal location.

```
mov.w   #0xff, &0x1111    ;this instruction moves the immediate value 0xff to the memory location 0x1111
mov.w   #0xff, &P1OUT    ;this instruction moves the immediate value 0xff to the memory location P1OUT
```

WARNING - potential pitfall:
```
mov.b   P1OUT,r7        ;in this case, the assembler will interpret P1OUT as PC-relative!  Since P1OUT is a constant memory location, the offset will change after linking!  This could crash the CPU if it references unbacked memory
```
Is not the same as:
```
mov.b   &P1OUT,r7       ;this is what you need to do to move the value in memory location P1OUT into r7
```

It's all about relocatable code.  The first one will generate PC-relative.  But P1OUT is at a specific location in memory.  When our code gets relocated, that offset will be different!  Making this mistake is a good way to crash your chip.

Any questions?  I know this was pretty jam-packed - so make sure to do some self-study if you feel uncomfortable with this material.  Addressing modes are fundamental to assembly language programming.
## CompEx1 Intro

The purpose of this CompEx is to get you up and running with the MSP430 Development Kit and CodeComposer (or mspgcc, if you so choose).  By the end of this lab, you'll have written your first assembly program and programmed it to your MSP430.  This should be a breeze for you if you've been paying attention.
